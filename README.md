#  Tour of Go

This repository contains the stuff I am doing to experiment with Go.

Initially, following the tutorials at : tour.golang.org

## Salient Points
- This repo consists of the same filenames as the tour (easy to refer)
- I have re-written all the files, without a copy paste. 
    + This way we discover unseen and unnoticed things otherwise. 
    +
- Has added inline comments, for personal reference
- Consists of multiple folders
    + Basics/.. contains the first two lessons
    + FlowControl/... contains the lesson on flow control with the following exercises :-
        * exervice-loops-and-functions.go
    + MoreType/.. which contains structs, etc.
